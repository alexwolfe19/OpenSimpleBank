# OpenSimpleBank
Welcome to **OpenSimpleBank**, a pet project of mine, inspired by an old project. 

## Getting Started
Currently, there isn't much to be done here. I'm *very* slowly working on the project at the moment for fun when the mood strikes. This is a TypeScript project, to be ran in NodeJS (or similar desktop enviroment, I suppose, but not tested!) with Prisma for the ORM. Shouldn't need any fancy setup besides the `.env` file with database information and such.

The UI and such are mostly just there for my debugging, UI will be the last thing I end up doing, most likely.

### Enviroment Configuration

## Road Map
So I'm roughtly planning out the project, to break it into managable chunks for myself. I'll be putting that information in the wiki then,
but as for now, the project suports the most basic of functionality, I think...

## Inspiration
When playing games like Minecraft, I personally like to have some sort of economy in place to do trading with the other players. Now, I could be satisfied with just using diamonds or such, but that has obvious problems in of itself, so creating some currency in world is a usual good idea. I personally like using signed books, since it tells you when it is a counterfit! However, there's obvious issues with this - clunky, expensive IU, and who's to say anyone will trust you as banker. Then you'll have dozens of banks, with their own bills, which you *can't even stack*, so you'll need an inventory full of signed books!
Having an actual currency makes all of this easier, but designing a whole system for the currency still wouldn't fix one problem - who says anyone will trust me? Even if we all used the same software, you'd have to be switching from page to page for transactions, and multi-currency trades could get annoying! Hence, the idea for **OSB** was made.
